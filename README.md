# Momembark

Momembark combines the popular minimalist Chrome new tab extensions, Momentum and Embark. It integrates the date-time and clock of Embark into the framework of Momentum, which has a todo list, customization, and weather. 

This project was inspired by both Momentum and Embark. Both of them have a great minimalist style, but I really liked the animated clock and style of Embark and found the todo and weather aspect of Momentum awesome. Note, this was a fan project and I'm not looking to commercialize this at all.
